![image](images/Cross-Course-Project.png)


## Description

This cross-course project is designed, developed and has been improved upon throughout my studies @![Noroff](https://www.noroff.no/en/).
The development of the project started the moment i enrolled into the school and with each passing course the website was built upon and improved into what you see today (EU - 08.12.22 | US - 12.08.22).
In general, the website incorporates real world project development processes that are focused on research based, user-centric design and development methodologies.
