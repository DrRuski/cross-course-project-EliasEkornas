# Cross-Course Project

![image](images/Cross-Course-Project.png)


## Description

This cross-course project has been designed, developed and improved throughout my studies @![Noroff](https://www.noroff.no/en/).
The development of the project started when I enrolled into the school and with each passing course, the website was built upon and improved into what you see today (EU - 08.12.22 | US - 12.08.22).
In general, the website incorporates real-world project development processes that are focused on research-based and user-centric design and development methodologies.
